<h1>Correlates of cooperation</h1>

This project will evolve as I get more time to work on it, and the key
data and code can be found on <a
href="https://github.com/MarkCWilson/cooperation">Github</a>. All
the code is in R, consistently using the tidyverse and tidymodels
approach. The project comes from a paper with Antonio Arechar, An Jimenez, and 
Fatemeh Ghaffari. Basically, over 1600 human participants supplied demographic information,
and took one of two standard tests of inhibitory control  and a test of reasoning (the famous 3-question 
(Cognitive Reflection Test). They then explained their strategies for playing Repeated Prisoner's Dilemma
against a human opponent.

<h2> Data </h2>
The data was in pretty good shape in a flat CSV file, and little
processing was needed. To describe game strategies, participants gave a
probability (which we normalize to the range 0 to 1) of cooperating on
the first round, and in each of the 4 scenarios based on the last move
(e.g. I cooperated but my opponent defected).

<h2> Derived data</h2>

We devised two global measures intended to summarize player behavior.
One is a simple measure C of cooperation, defined as the mean of the 5
probabilities mentioned above. The other is more subtle, being a measure
R of what we call reactivity (how much the player's probability of
cooperation varies with the opponent's last move).


<h2> Interesting findings</h2>

When it comes to cooperativity, there are noticeable differences. There is not much difference between male and female, 
but those who identify as white (plus perhaps other races) have markedly higher scores than those who do not supply a 
 "white" racial classification.

Interestingly, there appears to be a difference between male and female participants when it comes 
to reactivity, and higher scores for white vs nonwhite classification. The biggest effect is seen when comparing those 
having low CRT scores with the highest scorers.

 <h2> Prediction</h2>
 
We can try to classify whether a subject is male or female, for example, based on ****.

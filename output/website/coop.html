<h1>Correlates of cooperation</h1>

This project will evolve as I get more time to work on it, and the key
data and code can be found on <a
href="https://github.com/MarkCWilson/cooperation">Github</a>. All the
code is in R, consistently using the tidyverse and tidymodels approach.
The project comes from a paper with Antonio Arechar, An Jimenez, and
Fatemeh Ghaffari. Basically, over 1600 human participants supplied
demographic information, and took one of two standard tests of
inhibitory control  and a test of reasoning (the famous 3-question
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_reflection_test">Cognitive Reflection Test</a>). 
They then explained their strategies for
playing <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma#
The_iterated_prisoner's_dilemma">Repeated Prisoner's Dilemma</a> against
a human opponent.

<h2> Data </h2>
The data was in pretty good shape in a flat CSV file, and little
processing was needed (it had 52 columns, many of which are of marginal
relevance, and we cut them down mostly by using domain knowledge). One
tricky part was that the self-reported racial classification data could
contain more than one race, and this data was presented as a string. In
order to avoid having very small numbers in a given racial category, I
decided in the end to distinguish only between those who identify as
white (plus perhaps other races), which I called "white", and those who
did not supply a "white" racial classification (``nonwhite").

To describe game strategies, participants gave a
probability (which we normalize to the range 0 to 1) of cooperating on
the first round, and in each of the 4 scenarios based on the last move
(e.g. I cooperated but my opponent defected).



<h3> Derived data</h3>

We devised two global measures intended to summarize player behavior.
One is a simple measure C of cooperation, defined as the mean of the 5
probabilities mentioned above. The other is more subtle, being a measure
R of what we call reactivity (how much the player's probability of
cooperation varies with the opponent's last move).

<h2> Interesting findings</h2>

Much of the analysis ended up showing very little  predictive value of
the inhibitory control measures. The most interesting results were that
race, gender, and CRT score were more predictive than we had expected.

When it comes to cooperativity, there are noticeable differences. There
is not much difference between male and female, but those who identify
as white have markedly higher scores than
those who are nonwhite. Cooperativity increases with higher CRT scores.

The empirical CDF shows this another way, and the differences are clear.

Interestingly, there appears to be a difference between male and female
participants when it comes to reactivity, and higher scores for white vs
nonwhite classification. The biggest effect is seen when comparing those
having low CRT scores with the highest scorers.

Again the ecdf makes this clear.

 <h2> Prediction</h2>

We can try to classify whether a subject is male or female, for example.
Using a simple logistic regression model with just C, R and CRT score as
predictors, we achieve accuracy of 64%. Note that the mean CRT score for
 males was 2.15 and that for females 1.53. For white versus nonwhite we
obtain 1.88 versus 1.49.

<h2> Future work</h2>
The large differences in CRT scores between male and female participants seems strange (note that we had 
over 500 participants of each type). It might be an artifact of the participant pool in these online 
experiments, but should be looked into more.
